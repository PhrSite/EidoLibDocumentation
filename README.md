# The EidoLibDocumentation Project
This is the GitHub Pages documentation project for the EidoLib class library.

This is a [DocFX](https://dotnet.github.io/docfx) project so DocFX must be installed on your system before you can build the documentation GitHub Pages static web site for the EidoLib project.

To build the documentation, open a command prompt and change to the the EidoLibDocumentation directory and then type docfx.

** Note: The docfx.json configuration file uses a relative path to the EidoLib project so the EidoLibDocumentation project must be located at the same directory level as the EidoLib project. For example, if the EidoLib project is located under c:\MyProjects, then the EidoLibDocumentation project must also be located under \MyProjects.**

The documentation web site on github.io is setup to deploy the static web site when this project is pushed to GitHub. The documentation pages are located at [https://phrsite.github.io/EidoLibDocumentation](https://phrsite.github.io/EidoLibDocumentation).
